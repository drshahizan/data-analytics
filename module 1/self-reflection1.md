# Self-Reflection: Collecting data
[Source](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/quiz/XJ30Y/self-reflection-collecting-data)
## Overview

Now that you are familiar with the phases of the data life cycle, you can take a moment to think about your learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about collecting data and how data collection fits into the data life cycle.

To start, you will consider a simple scenario: discussing the data life cycle in a mock interview for a data analyst role. Then, you will respond to three brief questions. You‚Äôve done the hard work to learn the basics of the data life cycle, so get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick! 

## The scenario: interview for a data analyst position

Imagine that you interview for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. The hiring manager explains that the company needs a data analyst because they want to learn more about their customers. First, they want to understand their customers‚Äô ice cream flavor preferences. Then, they will use this customer data to help make important decisions. 

The hiring manager explains that they do not collect any customer data, and they don‚Äôt know where to begin. The hiring manager asks you: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?

Before responding to the question, you consider each step of the data life cycle.

## Recap: The data life cycle

The steps of the data life cycle are:

- Plan: What plans and decisions do you need to make? What data do you need to answer your question?

- Capture: Where does your data come from? How will you get it?

- Manage: How will you store your data? What should it be used for? How do you keep this data secure and protected?

- Analyze: How will the company analyze the data? What tools should they use?

- Archive: What should they do with their data when it gets old? How do they know when it's time?

- Destroy: Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and how?

## Reflection

Consider your learning about the steps of the data life cycle and reflect on the hiring manager‚Äôs request. Review the following questions to help guide your thinking: 

- What kind of data should they gather? 

- How should they gather this data? 

- Where will the data live? How will they store the data?

- Once they have the data, how will they use it? 

- How do they keep their data secure and protected? 

- What should they do with old data? What are their options?

In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) that explains your recommendation for how the ice cream company should collect customer flavor preference data.
