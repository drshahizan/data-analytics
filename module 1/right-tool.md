# Choosing the right tool for the job
As a data analyst, you will usually have to decide which program or solution is right for the particular project you are working on. In this reading, you will learn more about how to choose which tool you need and when. 

Depending on which phase of the data analysis process you‚Äôre in, you will need to use different tools. For example, if you are focusing on creating complex and eye-catching visualizations, then the visualization tools we discussed earlier are the best choice. But if you are focusing on organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, then you will probably be choosing between spreadsheets and databases using queries. Spreadsheets and databases both offer ways to store, manage, and use data. The basic content for both tools are sets of values. Yet, there are some key differences, too:

| Spreadsheets   | Databases |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Software applications | Data stores - accessed using a query language (e.g. SQL) |
| Structure data in a row and column format | Structure data using rules and relationships |
| Organize information in cells | Organize information in complex collections |
| Provide access to a limited amount of data | Provide access to huge amounts of data |
| Manual data entry | Strict and consistent data entry |
| Generally one user at a time | Multiple users  |
| Controlled by the user | Controlled by a database management system |

You don‚Äôt have to choose one or the other because each serves its own purpose. Generally, data analysts work with a combination of the two, as both tools are very useful in data analytics. For example, you can store data in a database, then export it to a spreadsheet for analysis. Or, if you are collecting information in a spreadsheet, and it becomes too much for that particular platform, you can import it into a database. And, later in this course, you will learn about programming languages like R that give you even greater control of your data, its analysis, and the visualizations you create. 

As you continue learning about these important tools, you will gain the knowledge to choose the right tool for any data job.
