# Variations of the data life cycle
[Source](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/DoiXy/variations-of-the-data-life-cycle)

You learned that there are six stages to the data life cycle. Here is a recap:

1. Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

2. Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.

3. Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

4. Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

5. Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

6. Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

**Warning:** Be careful not to mix up or confuse the six stages of the data life cycle (Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archive, and Destroy) with the six phases of the data analysis life cycle (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act). They shouldn't be used or referred to interchangeably.

The data life cycle provides a generic or common framework for how data is managed. You may recall that variations of the data analysis life cycle were described in Origins of the data analysis process. The same can be done for the data life cycle. The rest of this reading provides a glimpse of how government, finance, and education institutions can view data life cycles a little differently.

## U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the following data life cycle:

1. Plan

2. Acquire

3. Maintain

4. Access 

5. Evaluate

6. Archive

For more information, refer to [U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Data Management Life Cycle](https://www.fws.gov/data/life-cycle) page.

## The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
The USGS uses the data life cycle below:

1. Plan

2. Acquire

3. Process

4. Analyze

5. Preserve

6. Publish/Share

Several cross-cutting or overarching activities are also performed during each stage of their life cycle:

- Describe (metadata and documentation)

- Manage Quality

- Backup and Secure

For more information, refer to the [USGS Data Lifecycle](https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/data-lifecycle) page.

## Financial institutions
Financial institutions may take a slightly different approach to the data life cycle as described in [The Data Life Cycle](https://sfmagazine.com/articles/2018/july/the-data-life-cycle/), an article in Strategic Finance magazine:

1. Capture

2. Qualify

3. Transform

4. Utilize

5. Report

6. Archive

7. Purge

## Harvard Business School (HBS)
One final data life cycle informed by Harvard University research has eight stages:

1. Generation

2. Collection

3. Processing

4. Storage 

5. Management

6. Analysis

7. Visualization

8. Interpretation
