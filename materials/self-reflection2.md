# Self-Reflection: Reviewing past concepts

## Overview

Now that you have been introduced to working with data, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about the data analysis process and data life cycle, then respond to brief questions. 

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of the phases of data analysis to your data analysis toolbox. As you answer questions‚Äîand come up with questions of your own‚Äîyou will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You‚Äôve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Review the phases of data

So far you‚Äôve learned about the data analysis process and the data life cycle. They include the following steps:

**Data Analysis Process:**
- Ask

- Prepare

- Process

- Analyze

- Share

- Act

**Data Life Cycle:**
- Plan

- Capture

- Manage

- Analyze

- Archive

- Destroy

For a refresher on the phases of data, you can review the reading on the data analysis process and the video on the data life cycle.

## Reflection

Consider what you reviewed about the phases of data:

- What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

- What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?

Reflect on your learning and think about how you can apply the phases of data to future projects.

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.
