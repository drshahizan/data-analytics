# Hands-On Activity: Generating a chart from a spreadsheet

## Activity overview


So far, you have planned a project, identified the data you need, and collected the data. Earlier in this course, you completed a learning log where you recorded some data from your daily life, then took the practical step of organizing it. Now, you’re ready for the most satisfying step of the data analysis project: visualizing your data! 

For this activity, you will move your data to a spreadsheet and bring it to life in a chart. By the time you complete this activity, you will understand how to create a simple graphical representation of information. This is a skill data analysts use to make data easy to understand and interesting to look at. It’s important for reports, presentations, infographics, and more.


## What you will need

To get started, first determine what software you’d like to use. We suggest using Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to create your chart.

Save the spreadsheet with your preferred file naming convention, and store it in a folder to help you stay organized.

## Working with spreadsheets

Now that you have a template ready, you can start the activity: 

**Step 1: Open a spreadsheet**
Open your spreadsheet in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. 

**Step 2: Familiarize yourself with the spreadsheet**
If you are already familiar with spreadsheets, that’s great! If spreadsheets are new to you, don’t worry—they are just like the table you created in a previous activity. 

To get familiar with spreadsheets, you should consider a spreadsheet’s format:

- Each rectangular block is a **cell**. 

- Each cell is meant for one data point, just like in the table you created previously. 

Now, consider the cells that run across the top of the spreadsheet (horizontally) and along the left side of the spreadsheet (vertically):

- Cells are organized by columns and rows.

- Each column has a distinct letter, and each row has a distinct number. 

- Each cell has a unique identifier composed of the column letter and row number. This identifier is like the cell’s address.

You also have a chart embedded in the spreadsheet. However, the chart is blank, because it doesn’t have any data yet. Next, you will add data!  

**Step 3: Add your data**
Now, you can add your own data from previous learning logs to the spreadsheet. Notice that cell A1 contains the label “Date”, and cell B1 contains the label “Value”.  

This lines up with the same structure you used in the table you created in a previous learning log entry, where you recorded data from your daily life. Just like your table, all the “date” parts of your data points go in the cells in column A, and the values you recorded on those dates go in the corresponding cells in column B. It should display like this: 

Date

Value

10/19

2.5

10/20

2

10/21

1

10/22

1.5

10/23

1.5


Next, take all of the data that you previously recorded in your learning log and use it to populate the spreadsheet in the appropriate columns: Add the dates in column A, and the values in column B.

Once you finish adding your data to the spreadsheet, your table will display like this:

Next, you will update the chart in your spreadsheet based on the data you entered. 

**Step 4: Reviewing your chart**
Now that you’ve entered your data into the Date and Value columns, your spreadsheet should display like this:

Did you notice what happened to the chart when you entered the data in the spreadsheet? The spreadsheet visualized the data for you by making it into a basic bar chart. There are many different ways to customize charts, but first you need to clean up your chart. Then, you can interpret the data visualization! 

**Step 5: Cleaning up your chart**
Now that you have a chart, it’s time to clean it up. It’s generally a good idea to tidy your chart by making it descriptive and aesthetically pleasing. Keep in mind that good data analysts are data storytellers! 

To change the title of your chart, double click on the chart. You should find that a “Chart Editor” menu displays on the side of your screen. Click on “Chart & axis titles”, and then enter the name of your chart in the “Title Text” box:

If you’re using Microsoft Excel, you can double click on the title in the chart to edit directly.

Don’t be afraid to play around with the options here: You can always download another copy of the template if you make a mistake you can’t fix! 

## Confirmation and reflection

After you added data to the spreadsheet, you cleaned up the chart. What step did you take to make the chart descriptive? 

- Adding a title to the chart

- Changing the color of the chart

- Removing the dates from the chart

- Converting the bar chart to a pie chart


Question 2
You have come a long way! You started recording your data manually, you loaded that data into a spreadsheet, and you visualized the data in a chart. Now, take a moment to examine your completed data visualization. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

- How did you use a spreadsheet to help prepare your data? 

- How did you format your chart to help you analyze your data?
